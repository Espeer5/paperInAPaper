I think we should simply use the commercially available LLM that leads the way
in reasoning benchmarks.
 - Claude 3.5 Sonnet
     - leads in GPQA (graduate level reasoning)
     - Math (grade school & multilingual)
     - Reasoning over text (DROP)
     - Mixed Evaluations (BIG-Bench-Hard)
     - Undergraduate level knowledge

The reasoning skill provides the most potential to address the foreseen (and
encountered) issues with Llama — inability to reason through a full academic 
argument well.

Should we pass in relevant literature to use as sources? Or is that loading up
the prompt too much?

Write an 8000 word undergraduate philosophy thesis, structured with an
introduction section, background section, original argument, and conclusion.
Use formal academic tone and cite literature as appropriate. Answer the
following prompt:

Algorithms are being used more frequently to make social decisions. There are
a number of proposed fairness metrics that can be used to measure statistical
fairness conditions on the output of decision making models, but it is not
possible to satisfy all of them on any particular model. As a result, we must
choose which measures to use on any given problem, and it is not always clear
which measure we should prefer. Recent papers have shown a link between
algorithmic fairness and theories of distributive justice in an effort to
clarify how these measures should be thought of philosophically. Egalitarianism
dominates much of the philosophical literature cited, which appears to be a
natural fit. Algorithmic fairness measures typically measure how goods are
allocated to different groups, and search for some measure of equality between
them. This structure is egalitarian in measuring quality between entities.
However, egalitarian measures only form one side of the literature on
distributive justice. Whereas egalitarian theories measure the fairness of 
particular distributions of goods across society, libertarian theories, 
particularly Nozick's theory of entitlement justice study the processes by which
distributions came about to define fairness. For Nozick, justice is satisfied if
a distribution came about through a series of just acquisitions and transfers in
a free market. This theory is structurally quite different from egalitarian 
theories, and it is unclear how a theory structured in this way could be
reflected in algorithmic fairness measures. This means a large proportion of the
literature on distributive justice has been left out of the discussion of 
algorithmic fairness measures. Develop an account of algorithmic fairness which
is based on Nozick's entitlement justice and devise a measure of fairness which 
can be used to determine if an algorithm is just according to Nozick's theory.

Your thesis should begin by clearly explaining key fairness metrics (e.g.,
demographic parity, equalized odds) and the core concepts of egalitarian and
libertarian justice. Then, formulate a definition of algorithmic fairness
grounded in entitlement theory (e.g., Nozick’s principles of acquisition,
transfer, and rectification). This definition of fairness should allow for the
algorithm to give rise to highly inequitable output distributions across groups
as long as those inequities arose in a manner which would be considered just by
Nozick. Apply this framework to a hypothetical or real-world example (e.g.,
loan approval or hiring), and compare the outcomes to egalitarian models. In
each major section, make your assumptions explicit, justify your philosophical
claims with textual support or example cases, and anticipate possible objections
to the entitlement-based framework.
