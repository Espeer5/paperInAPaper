# Entitlement Justice and Measures of Algorithmic Fairness

## Introduction
 - Summarize importance of algorithmic fairness measures
 - Introduce the concept of entitlement justice
 - Introduce argument
   - Entitlement justice is important in algorithmic fairness, but historically neglected in discussions of fairness measures
   - (Some/certain) counterfactuals measures emphasize entitlement justice, resolving this neglect

## Entitlement Justice
 - Present Nozick's theory of entitlement justice
 - Aknowledge known issues, but extract key points of relevance
 - Present advantages of entitlement justice (including examples from domains relevant to algorithmic decision makers)

## Algorithmic Fairness Measures
 - Present formalism of algorithmic fairness measures
 - Present common measures and hisotry of their devlopment
   - i.e, why was each measure developed, what does it aim to capture

## Entitlement Justice in Algorithmic Fairness
 - In what sense are algorithmic decision makers relevant to property decisions
   - Present college admissions case
 - How do common fairness measures fail to capture entitlement justice
    - Present examples from college admissions case
 - Justification of how entitlement justice would resolve issues with algorithmic decision makers
   - Include short notes on the psychology of justice associated with algorithmic decisions

## Counterfactual Fairness and Entitlement Justice
 - To what extent do counterfactual fairness measures capture entitlement justice?
 - Discuss with issues of counterfactual fairness measures
   - socially constructed race, gender, etc
   - Difficulty of establishing non-normative causality

## Conclusion
- Summarize argument
- Present future directions for research
    - In particular, how to resolve issues with counterfactual fairness measures and socially constructed variables/identities
- Present implications for algorithmic decision makers
