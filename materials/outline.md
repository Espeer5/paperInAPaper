# Entitlement Theory and Algorithmic Fairness Measures

## Introduction
 - Motivations: 
   - Algorithmic decision makers increasingly used, sparking public fears about fairness
   - Algorithmic fairness measures proposed – often treated as philosophical distributive justice, but this point is unclear
 - Introduce entitlement theory as an alternative approach, and outline the paper
## Background

 - Present typical account of distributive justice – formalism and the many typical competing approaches
 - Present the typical account of algorithmic fairness measures, including the typical measures and their shortcomings
## Entitlement Theory

 - Present the historical development of entitlement justice from Nozick to the present
 - Describe how entitlement theory constitutes a suitable model of distributive justice
 - Discuss the underpinnigs of entitlement theory, including the issues with property rights and surplus value
## Entitlement Fairness
 - Present the main argument: conceptualization of algorithmic fairness through the lens of entitlement theory
 - Develop this into a framwork for enforcing fairness in algorithmic decision making in a particular context
 - Present case study (TODO/ES: MAY OR MAY NOT BE INCLUDED)
 
## Conlusion
 - Summarize the main points of the paper
 - Discuss the implications of the paper for the field of algorithmic fairness and distributive justice
 - Note the importance of considering algorithmic decision makers within the broader sociotechnical system in which they operate
 - Discuss the limitations of the paper and future work
