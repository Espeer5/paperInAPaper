Structurally, how do algorithmic decisions relate to entitlement?

Handing down an algorithmic decision determines whether one is able to acquire property. This is true regardless of the type of property in question. With a loan, capital is clearly property, but with a decision like a job or college admissions, the property is less tangible but property nonetheless. There is a clear precedent for discussing these types of decisions as property decisions from the Rawlsian distributive justice perspective. 

Think of the admissions case. It becomes clear that a student acquires the holding of an admissions prior to the admissions decision. Through the student's portfolio, work, essays, test scores, etc. the student has acquired the property of the admissions. The admissions decision, then, becomes a decision as to whether or not the student has successfully acquired the property of the admissions. If a student has been denied an admission they were entitled to as one of their holdings, then the admissions process has robbed them of their property right. 

The crux of the argument becomes the idea that an admissions decision is a decision about who has the right to the property of the admissions. There are two ways the student can have the property right - either through pure acquisition, or through a property of rectification of some kind - this would be a form of affirmative action to help rectify past wrongs.

We need to say something here about why the property of admissions is not transferrable - i.e why does the student not have the right to sell their admissions (or give their admissions) to another student. I see two routes to answering this:
 - This sort of transfer could be seen as self-defeating. I.e, one with the intentions to perform this sort of act are automatically disqualified from the admissions process.
 - The principle of justice of transfer requires there be no harm done to third parties through the transfer. Selling one's right to admissions would harm the other students who are competing for the same admissions, and could be seen as harming the institute itself.

I see strong paralleles between the selling of admissions and the selling of votes, political offices, etc. Nozick would probably like to say that an individual is entitled to their own vote, yet that votes can't be sold.

It seems also that in the admissions case, the transfer of admissions from one student to another would violate the case for justice in acquisition. So even if the justice of transfer was presevered, the justice of acquisition would be violated (since our justice of acquisition here is based inherently on the qualifications of students). Nozick holds that violators of the justice of acquisition through the process of transfer are not entitled to the property they have gained.

This intuition defeats a lot of common issues in admissions. For example, think of the legacy admissions case. This is a canonical injustice in admissions, and it is clear to see that this case is a transfer which does not respect the principle of justice in acquisition. Similarly, bribery or any other sort of transfer of admissions would be unjust.

Now lets return to the case for affirmative action. We wanted to say something about how affirmative action is a form of rectification as allowed by Nozick in his entitlement theory. However before we make a move towards rectification, there is something to be said here about justice in acquisition in the first place. Our principle of justice in acquisition when obtaining the affirmative admissions decision was based on the qualifications of the student. But we need to say more about what makes one qualified. Is a person who works hard to recover from a disadvantaged background qualified despite lower test scores or grades? I think there is a large extent to which we would like to say both yes and no, and it will somewhat depend on the values of the institution being applied to.

Set this aside, and we still have the rectrification case. People belonging to groups which have previously been discriminated against by these types of decisions are entitled to some rectification. This could be a form of justification for limited affirmative action, though it is unclear what exactly would represent a proportional rectification and how we could measure or determine this.
