Refresh me, what is our base argument at this time?
### llama3.1-70b.0:
Our base argument is that a counterfactual fairness measure can reflect the principles of entitlement justice, which prioritizes the idea that individuals have a right to the fruits of their labor and the benefits of their social and cultural heritage.

Specifically, we argue that a counterfactual fairness measure can be designed to take into account the historical context and past actions that have contributed to an individual's current situation, and to provide some form of retribution or rectification for past injustices or biases.

We believe that this approach can help to promote a more nuanced and equitable understanding of fairness in algorithmic decision-making, and can help to ensure that algorithmic decisions are fair and just.

Our argument is based on the idea that entitlement justice principles are essential for ensuring that individuals are treated with dignity and respect, and that their rights and interests are protected. We believe that by incorporating these principles into fairness measures, we can create a more just and equitable algorithmic decision-making system.
