Let's start working on our intro section. How should we lead the paper off?
### llama3.1-70b.0:
Let's start with a hook that grabs the reader's attention and sets the stage for the rest of the paper. Here's a possible opening sentence:

"As algorithms increasingly shape the decisions that affect our lives, from college admissions to job hiring and loan approvals, the need for fairness and transparency in these systems has become a pressing concern."

This sentence introduces the topic of algorithmic fairness and highlights its importance in modern society. It also sets the stage for the rest of the paper, which will explore the limitations of traditional fairness measures and propose a new approach based on entitlement justice.

Next, we could provide some background on the current state of algorithmic fairness research and the challenges that it faces. For example:

"While significant progress has been made in developing fairness measures for algorithms, these measures often rely on simplistic notions of fairness that fail to account for the complexities of real-world decision-making. In particular, traditional fairness measures often focus on achieving parity between different groups, without considering the individual circumstances and entitlements that underlie these decisions."

This paragraph sets up the problem that our paper aims to address, and provides a brief overview of the limitations of traditional fairness measures. It also introduces the concept of entitlement justice, which will be the focus of the rest of the paper.

Finally, we could provide a thesis statement that summarizes the main argument of the paper. For example:

"In this paper, we propose a new approach to algorithmic fairness based on the principles of entitlement justice. By recognizing individuals' entitlements to their own labor, skills, and achievements, we can develop fairness measures that are more nuanced and effective than traditional approaches."

This thesis statement provides a clear summary of the paper's main argument and sets the stage for the rest of the discussion.
