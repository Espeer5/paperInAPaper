What would you expect to see in a high-level/vague outline of our paper so far?
### llama3.1-70b.0:
Based on our discussion, I would expect to see a high-level outline of our paper that includes the following elements:

I. Introduction

* Introduce the concept of algorithmic fairness and its importance in modern society
* Discuss the limitations of traditional fairness measures and the need for a more nuanced approach
* Introduce the concept of entitlement justice and its potential application to algorithmic fairness

II. Background

* Provide an overview of the current state of algorithmic fairness research and its limitations
* Discuss the concept of entitlement justice and its roots in philosophical theory
* Introduce the idea of using entitlement justice as a framework for algorithmic fairness

III. Entitlement Justice and Algorithmic Fairness

* Discuss the key principles of entitlement justice and how they can be applied to algorithmic fairness
* Introduce the concept of "property" and its relationship to entitlement justice
* Discuss how entitlement justice can provide a more nuanced and effective approach to algorithmic fairness

IV. Case Study: College Admissions

* Use the college admissions case as a concrete example of how entitlement justice can be applied to algorithmic fairness
* Discuss the limitations of traditional fairness measures in this context and how entitlement justice can provide a more effective solution

V. Conclusion

* Summarize the main points of the paper and the potential benefits of using entitlement justice as a framework for algorithmic fairness
* Discuss future directions for research and the potential applications of entitlement justice in other areas of algorithmic fairness.

This is just a rough outline, and I'm sure we can add or modify sections as needed. But I hope this gives you a sense of the overall structure and direction of our paper!
### USER:
Lets divide that background section into two segments, one about entitlement and one about algorithmic fairness measures
### llama3.1-70b.0:
Here is the updated outline:

I. Introduction

* Introduce the concept of algorithmic fairness and its importance in modern society
* Discuss the limitations of traditional fairness measures and the need for a more nuanced approach
* Introduce the concept of entitlement justice and its potential application to algorithmic fairness

II. Background

* A. Entitlement Justice
	+ Provide an overview of the concept of entitlement justice and its roots in philosophical theory
	+ Discuss the key principles of entitlement justice, including the idea of "property" and its relationship to individual rights and interests
* B. Algorithmic Fairness Measures
	+ Provide an overview of the current state of algorithmic fairness research and its limitations
	+ Discuss the different types of algorithmic fairness measures, including parity-based measures and individual fairness measures
	+ Introduce the idea of using entitlement justice as a framework for algorithmic fairness

III. Counterfactual Fairness and Entitlement

* Discuss the key principles of entitlement justice and how they can be applied to algorithmic fairness
* Introduce the concept of "property" and its relationship to entitlement justice
* Discuss how entitlement justice can provide a more nuanced and effective approach to algorithmic fairness

IV. Case Study: College Admissions

* Use the college admissions case as a concrete example of how entitlement justice can be applied to algorithmic fairness
* Discuss the limitations of traditional fairness measures in this context and how entitlement justice can provide a more effective solution

V. Conclusion

* Summarize the main points of the paper and the potential benefits of using entitlement justice as a framework for algorithmic fairness
* Discuss future directions for research and the potential applications of entitlement justice in other areas of algorithmic fairness.

This should help to break up the background section into two more manageable parts, and provide a clearer overview of the concepts and ideas that we will be discussing in the paper.
