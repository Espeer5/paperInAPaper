Please recap for me where we are so far.
### llama3.1-70b.0:
We've been working on a research paper that explores the concept of entitlement justice in the context of algorithmic fairness. Here's a brief recap of where we are so far:

* We've defined our research question: "How can algorithmic fairness measures, specifically counterfactual fairness measures, be designed to reflect the principles of entitlement justice, including considerations of historical context, past actions, and rectification?"
* We've discussed the motivations for our project, including the limitations of traditional fairness measures and the need for a more nuanced approach that takes into account individual differences and interests.
* We've explored the concept of property and its relationship to entitlement justice, including the idea that property is a bundle of rights and entitlements that individuals have to their possessions and achievements.
* We've used the college admissions case as a concrete example of how entitlement justice can be applied to algorithmic fairness, highlighting the limitations of traditional fairness measures and the potential benefits of using entitlement justice as a framework.
* We've sketched out a high-level outline of our paper, including sections on introduction, background, entitlement justice and algorithmic fairness, and conclusion.

Let me know if there's anything else I can help with or if you'd like to continue working on the paper!
