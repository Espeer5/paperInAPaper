We were working on our intro. I've just set the scene of public concerns over algorithmic decision making perpetuating social injustices. I then described the way that the literature has seperated into explainability/interpretability concerns on one hand and algorithmic fairness measures on the other. Here is what I just wrote. "The first, which we will refer to as algorithmic fairness, focuses on developing statistical and computational tools to ensure that algorithms do not discriminate against pretected groups. The second... focuses on explainability... interpret the decisions made by algorithms." Where should I go from here to start narrowing down to talking about how distributive justice concerns are reflected through the first area of the literature about algorithmic fairness. 
### llama3.1-70b.0:
You've set the scene nicely and described the two main areas of concern in the literature. To start narrowing down to the topic of distributive justice concerns in algorithmic fairness, you could try to highlight the limitations of the current approaches to algorithmic fairness and explainability.

Here's a possible direction to take:

"While the development of algorithmic fairness measures has been a crucial step in addressing concerns about algorithmic decision-making, these measures have largely focused on ensuring that algorithms do not discriminate against protected groups in a narrow sense. However, this focus on non-discrimination has led to a lack of attention to the broader distributive justice concerns that are raised by algorithmic decision-making. In particular, the literature on algorithmic fairness has not fully grappled with the question of how algorithms should distribute benefits and burdens in a way that is fair and just.

To address this gap, we argue that the literature on algorithmic fairness needs to be supplemented with a consideration of distributive justice concerns. In particular, we need to think about how algorithms can be designed to promote distributive justice, rather than simply avoiding discrimination. This requires a more nuanced understanding of the ways in which algorithms can perpetuate social injustices, and a more comprehensive approach to addressing these injustices."

This is just one possible direction to take, but the idea is to highlight the limitations of the current approaches to algorithmic fairness and explainability, and to argue that a more comprehensive approach is needed to address the distributive justice concerns raised by algorithmic decision-making.
### USER:
The way I want to take it is to say something (with a citation) about how the study of fairness measures is often associated with distributive justice, but that recent papers question and undermine this conceptualization.
### llama3.1-70b.0:
Here's a possible way to take it:

"While the study of fairness measures is often associated with distributive justice (e.g., [ citation to a paper that makes this association ]), recent papers have questioned and undermined this conceptualization. For example, [ citation to a paper that critiques this association ], argues that fairness measures are often too narrow and focused on individual-level fairness, rather than considering the broader distributive implications of algorithmic decision-making. Similarly, [ citation to another paper that critiques this association ], suggests that the focus on fairness measures has led to a neglect of other important values, such as equality and justice.

These critiques highlight the need for a more nuanced understanding of the relationship between fairness measures and distributive justice. Rather than assuming that fairness measures are sufficient to ensure distributive justice, we need to consider the ways in which algorithms can perpetuate social injustices, and develop a more comprehensive approach to addressing these injustices."

This approach acknowledges the association between fairness measures and distributive justice, but also highlights the critiques and challenges to this conceptualization. By citing recent papers that question this association, you can show that the field is actively debating and rethinking the relationship between fairness measures and distributive justice.
