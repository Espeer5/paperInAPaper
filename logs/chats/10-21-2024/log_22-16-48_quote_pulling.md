# CHAT LOG WITH MODEL llama3.1-70b

Here I am checking whether the model can pull out quotes from papers/books with accurate page numbers from its training set. It passed this simple test, though of course every single quote or citation given will always need to be checked.

### USER:
Please give me a quote from Critique of Pure Reason with the correct page number
### llama3.1-70b.0:
"Concepts without percepts are empty; percepts without concepts are blind." 

- Immanuel Kant, Critique of Pure Reason (A51/B75)
### USER:
Give me a quote from "Utilitarianism" with a page number that mentions Socrates
### llama3.1-70b.0:
"It is better to be a human being dissatisfied than a pig satisfied; better to be Socrates dissatisfied than a fool satisfied."

- John Stuart Mill, Utilitarianism (Chapter 2, page 10 in the 1861 edition)
