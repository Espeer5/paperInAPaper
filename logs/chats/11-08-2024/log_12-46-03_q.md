At this point, let's take stock. How would you succinctly phrase our research question?
### llama3.1-70b.0:
Based on our discussion, I would suggest the following research question:

"How can algorithmic fairness measures, specifically counterfactual fairness measures, be designed to reflect the principles of entitlement justice, including considerations of historical context, past actions, and retribution?"

This question captures the main themes of our discussion, including the use of counterfactual fairness measures, the incorporation of historical context and past actions, and the consideration of retribution as a key aspect of entitlement justice.
