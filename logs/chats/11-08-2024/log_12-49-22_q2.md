Ok, now please help me succinctly state the motivations for this project. Why do we think entitlement justice principles need to be reflected in fairness measures?
### llama3.1-70b.0:
Based on our discussion, I would suggest the following motivations for the project:

"We believe that traditional fairness measures, which focus on statistical parity and individual fairness, are insufficient for addressing the concerns of justice in algorithmic decision-making. Entitlement justice principles, which prioritize the idea that individuals have a right to the fruits of their labor and the benefits of their social and cultural heritage, are essential for ensuring that algorithmic decisions are fair and just. Reflecting these principles in fairness measures is necessary for (1) acknowledging and rectifying past injustices and biases, (2) recognizing the inherent value and dignity of individuals, and (3) promoting a more nuanced and equitable understanding of fairness in algorithmic decision-making."

This statement captures the motivations for the project, including the need to go beyond traditional fairness measures, the importance of entitlement justice principles, and the specific goals of promoting justice, dignity, and equity in algorithmic decision-making.
