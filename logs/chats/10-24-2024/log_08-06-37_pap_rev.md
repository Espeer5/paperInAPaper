### llama3.1-70b.0:
"Procedural Versus Substantive Justice: Rawls and Nozick" is a paper by David Lewis Schaefer that compares and contrasts the philosophical views of John Rawls and Robert Nozick on the concept of justice. 

Rawls, in his book "A Theory of Justice," argues that justice is a matter of fairness and that a just society is one that is governed by principles that would be agreed upon by rational individuals in a hypothetical "original position" behind a "veil of ignorance." Rawls' theory of justice is often characterized as a "substantive" theory, as it focuses on the distribution of goods and resources in society.

Nozick, on the other hand, in his book "Anarchy, State, and Utopia," argues that justice is a matter of respecting individual rights and that a just society is one that protects those rights. Nozick's theory of justice is often characterized as a "procedural" theory, as it focuses on the processes by which goods and resources are distributed, rather than the distribution itself.

Schaefer's paper argues that Rawls' substantive theory of justice is flawed because it fails to provide a clear and coherent account of what constitutes a just distribution of goods and resources. Schaefer also argues that Nozick's procedural theory of justice is more coherent and defensible, but that it is also limited in its ability to address issues of distributive justice.

Overall, Schaefer's paper provides a critical analysis of the philosophical views of Rawls and Nozick on the concept of justice, and argues that a more nuanced and balanced approach to justice is needed, one that takes into account both procedural and substantive considerations.

It's worth noting that this is a general summary, and the actual paper may have more specific arguments and details.
