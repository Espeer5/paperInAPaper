What a fascinating topic.  I'm excited to collaborate with you on this paper. Measures of algorithmic fairness have become increasingly important as algorithms play a larger role in decision-making processes that affect people's lives. 

To start, let's consider the different concepts of fairness that have been proposed in the literature. We have statistical parity, which aims to ensure that the outcomes of an algorithm are proportionally representative of the population. Then there's equalized odds, which seeks to balance the true positive and false positive rates across different groups. We also have calibration, which aims to ensure that the predicted probabilities of an algorithm are accurate for all groups.

However, these measures of fairness often come into conflict with one another, and it's not clear which one is the most just. For example, ensuring statistical parity may require sacrificing some accuracy, which could lead to unfair outcomes for individuals. On the other hand, prioritizing equalized odds may lead to unequal outcomes for different groups.

This raises questions about the concept of justice that these measures of fairness are trying to enforce. Are they based on a distributive justice framework, where the goal is to distribute benefits and harms fairly across different groups? Or are they based on a more individualistic conception of justice, where the focus is on ensuring that each individual is treated fairly?

How would you like to approach this topic? Should we delve deeper into the different measures of fairness and their limitations, or should we explore the underlying philosophical conceptions of justice that these measures are based on?
