# CHAT LOG WITH MODEL llama3.1-70b

This chat was an even simpler test of the application's ability to save bits of state throughout a conversation. It is clear that I will not be able to use this application to have a long conversation that uses context from previous messages until I add more functionality. This is a good enough start for now.
