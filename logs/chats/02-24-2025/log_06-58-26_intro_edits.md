Provide me with a philosophically rigorous defintion of a distributive theory of justice
### llama3.1-70b.0:
A distributive theory of justice is a philosophical framework that seeks to determine the fair and just distribution of resources, benefits, and burdens within a society. Here's a philosophically rigorous definition:

**Distributive Theory of Justice (DTJ):**

A distributive theory of justice is a normative framework that provides principles and criteria for allocating resources, benefits, and burdens among individuals or groups within a society, with the aim of achieving a just and fair distribution. A DTJ typically consists of three core components:

1. **Principle of Distribution (PD):** A principle that specifies the criteria for allocating resources, benefits, and burdens. Examples of PDs include:
	* Utilitarianism (maximizing overall happiness or well-being)
	* Egalitarianism (equal distribution of resources and benefits)
	* Prioritarianism (giving priority to the needs of the worst-off individuals or groups)
	* Libertarianism (protecting individual rights and freedoms)
2. **Metric of Distribution (MD):** A metric that measures the distribution of resources, benefits, and burdens. Examples of MDs include:
	* Income or wealth
	* Happiness or well-being
	* Capabilities or functionings (e.g., education, health, freedom)
	* Basic needs or primary goods (e.g., food, shelter, healthcare)
3. **Scope of Distribution (SD):** The scope of individuals or groups to whom the distributive principles apply. Examples of SDs include:
	* National borders (e.g., distributive justice within a country)
	* Global scope (e.g., distributive justice across countries)
	* Specific groups (e.g., distributive justice within a community or organization)

**Key Features of a DTJ:**

1. **Normativity:** A DTJ provides a normative framework for evaluating the fairness and justice of distributions.
2. **Universality:** A DTJ applies to all individuals or groups within the specified scope.
3. **Impartiality:** A DTJ is impartial in the sense that it does not favor any particular individual or group.
4. **Comparability:** A DTJ requires that the distribution of resources, benefits, and burdens be comparable across individuals or groups.

**Examples of Distributive Theories of Justice:**

1. John Rawls' **Justice as Fairness** (1971): A theory that combines a principle of equal basic liberties with a difference principle that prioritizes the needs of the worst-off individuals.
2. Robert Nozick's **Entitlement Theory** (1974): A libertarian theory that emphasizes individual rights and freedoms, and argues that distributive justice is a matter of respecting individual entitlements.
3. Amartya Sen's **Capability Approach** (1980s): A theory that focuses on the distribution of capabilities and functionings, rather than income or wealth.

**Challenges and Critiques:**

1. **Value Pluralism:** Different values and principles may lead to conflicting distributive theories.
2. **Measurement Challenges:** Measuring the distribution of resources, benefits, and burdens can be difficult, especially when dealing with complex metrics like happiness or well-being.
3. **Scope and Borders:** The scope of distribution can be contested, particularly in the context of globalization and international justice.

This definition provides a rigorous framework for understanding distributive theories of justice, highlighting the key components, features, and challenges associated with these theories.
