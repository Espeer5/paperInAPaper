### USER:
I'm interested in learning about entitlement theories of justice, particularly their benefits and how they apply in the modern world. What papers can I read?
### llama3.1-70b.0:
Entitlement theories of justice, also known as libertarian or rights-based theories, argue that individuals have certain moral entitlements or rights that should be respected and protected by society. Here are some key papers and authors to explore:

1. **Robert Nozick's "Anarchy, State, and Utopia" (1974)**: This book is a seminal work in the development of entitlement theory. Nozick argues that individuals have natural rights to life, liberty, and property, which should not be infringed upon by the state.
2. **John Locke's "Second Treatise of Government" (1689)**: Locke's work is a foundational text for modern libertarian thought. He argues that individuals have inherent rights to life, liberty, and property, which are protected by a social contract between citizens and their government.
3. **Friedrich Hayek's "The Constitution of Liberty" (1960)**: Hayek's book explores the relationship between individual freedom and the rule of law. He argues that a just society must protect individual rights and liberties through a system of constitutional governance.
4. **Murray Rothbard's "For a New Liberty" (1973)**: Rothbard was an influential anarcho-capitalist thinker who argued for the abolition of the state in favor of voluntary institutions.

Some more recent papers on entitlement theory include:

1. **Eric Mack's "Self-Ownership and Property Rights" (1990)**: Mack explores the concept of self-ownership as a foundation for property rights.
2. **Michael Otsuka's "Libertarianism without Inequality" (2003)**: Otsuka defends an egalitarian version of libertarianism that emphasizes equal access to resources rather than strict property rights.
3. **Jan Narveson's "The Libertarian Idea" (1988)**: Narveson provides an overview of libertarian thought and its implications for social justice.

To apply these ideas to modern issues:

1. Look into debates around taxation policy:
	* Michael Huemer's "The Problem with Taxation Is Not Just Economic; It Is Also Moral"
	* David Boaz' s"The Libertarian Case Against Taxation"
2 Explore discussions on intellectual property:
	* Stephan Kinsella' s"A Libertarian Theory Of Intellectual Property"
	* Tom G Palmer' s"The Philosophy Of Intellectual Property Law"
3 Investigate arguments around immigration policy:
	* Bryan Caplan' s"The Economics And Ethics Of Immigration Restrictions"

These resources will provide you with a solid foundation in entitlement theories of justice and their applications in various areas.

Would you like me to recommend any specific journals or online platforms where you can find more papers on this topic?
