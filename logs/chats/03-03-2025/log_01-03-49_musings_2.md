### USER:
Where are we at in our argument development
### llama3.1-70b.0:
We have made significant progress in developing our argument about using entitlements as a framework for thinking about algorithmic fairness.

We have:

1. Introduced the concept of entitlements and how they can be used to think about algorithmic fairness.
2. Discussed the importance of considering the distribution of deviations from the correct decision, rather than just the distribution of outcomes.
3. Developed a framework for thinking about algorithmic fairness using entitlements, which involves mapping every element in the input set to a binary variable - has the entitlement or doesn't.
4. Recognized the importance of distinguishing between the prediction step and the distribution of errors, and ensuring that protected characteristics do not have a causal role in the distribution of errors.

We have also touched on some of the key concepts and ideas that are relevant to our argument, including:

1. The concept of property rights and how they relate to entitlements.
2. The importance of considering the context and domain specificity of algorithmic decision-making.
3. The need to balance competing values and interests in algorithmic decision-making.

Overall, I think we have made a strong start in developing our argument, and we have a solid foundation to build on as we continue to refine and develop our ideas.

Next steps could include:

1. Further developing our framework for thinking about algorithmic fairness using entitlements.
2. Exploring the implications of our argument for different domains and contexts.
3. Considering potential counterarguments and criticisms of our approach.
4. Refining our language and terminology to ensure clarity and precision.

Let me know if you have any thoughts on where we should go next!
### USER:
I think what we have done is broken up the decision pipeline into two steps. First, we must predict a set of features. Next, we must use those features in an allocation rule to decide on the outcome for each individual. The entire pipeline has a measure of fairness which is clear - there is normative reasoning that maps from the extracted features to the allocation, and the protected characteristics must be separated from the outcome except through those features. This is a sort of modified counterfactual fairness. However, there is a hole that remains - do you see the hole in the argument?
### llama3.1-70b.0:
I think I see the hole in the argument. The hole is that we have not yet addressed the issue of how to ensure that the features extracted in the first step are fair and unbiased. In other words, we have not yet considered the potential for bias or unfairness in the feature extraction process itself.

This is a critical issue, because if the features extracted in the first step are biased or unfair, then the entire pipeline will be biased or unfair, regardless of how fair the allocation rule is. This means that we need to consider the fairness of the feature extraction process, and ensure that it is not introducing any biases or unfairness into the pipeline.

Is that the hole you were thinking of?
### USER:
Exactly. That is the precise hole. Keeping in mind that we are implementing a property rights oracle - the allocation goes from features of an individual to their property right to a holding - what is your proposal for how to fill this gap?
### llama3.1-70b.0:
I'm glad we've identified the hole in the argument.

To fill this gap, I propose that we use a fairness-aware feature extraction process that is specifically designed to ensure that the features extracted are fair and unbiased. This could involve using techniques such as:

1. Fair representation learning: This involves learning representations of individuals that are fair and unbiased, and that do not encode any protected characteristics.
2. Adversarial training: This involves training the feature extraction model to be robust to adversarial attacks that attempt to introduce bias or unfairness into the features.
3. Regularization techniques: This involves using regularization techniques, such as L1 or L2 regularization, to penalize the model for extracting features that are biased or unfair.

However, I think we can do better than just using these techniques. Since we are implementing a property rights oracle, I propose that we use a feature extraction process that is specifically designed to extract features that are relevant to the property right in question.

For example, if we are implementing a property rights oracle for a housing allocation system, we might extract features such as the individual's income, credit score, and rental history. These features are relevant to the property right in question, and are likely to be fair and unbiased.

To ensure that the feature extraction process is fair and unbiased, we could use a combination of the techniques I mentioned earlier, along with domain-specific knowledge and expertise to ensure that the features extracted are relevant and fair.

Additionally, we could also use techniques such as feature importance scores to identify which features are most relevant to the property right in question, and to ensure that the feature extraction process is not introducing any biases or unfairness into the pipeline.

What do you think? Is this a good proposal for filling the gap in the argument?
### USER:
You have not been specific at all. I need to know, regardless of what technique is used to build the feature predictor, how I can know that it is doing a good unbiased job predicting the feature. For exampe, you might think that the answer is predictive parity. However, if this were the case, we would need to keep in mind that differing base rates would cause unfairness to creep into the system. I need a specific, justified, quality proposal for how to diagnose the feature predictors as fair or unfair, with specific reasoning about property rights to defend it
### llama3.1-70b.0:
I apologize for the lack of specificity in my previous response. I understand that you need a concrete proposal for how to diagnose the feature predictors as fair or unfair, with specific reasoning about property rights to defend it.

Here is a proposal:

To diagnose the feature predictors as fair or unfair, I propose that we use a combination of two metrics: (1) the "entitlement-based" calibration metric, and (2) the "property rights-based" fairness metric.

**Entitlement-based calibration metric:**

This metric measures the degree to which the feature predictor is calibrated to the true entitlements of the individuals. In other words, it measures the degree to which the feature predictor is accurately predicting the features that are relevant to the property right in question.

To calculate this metric, we can use a calibration plot, which plots the predicted probabilities of the feature predictor against the true entitlements of the individuals. If the feature predictor is well-calibrated, the plot should show a diagonal line, indicating that the predicted probabilities are accurate.

**Property rights-based fairness metric:**

This metric measures the degree to which the feature predictor is fair and unbiased with respect to the property rights of the individuals. In other words, it measures the degree to which the feature predictor is not introducing any biases or unfairness into the system.

To calculate this metric, we can use a fairness metric such as the "counterfactual fairness" metric, which measures the degree to which the feature predictor is fair and unbiased with respect to the counterfactual outcomes of the individuals.

However, as you pointed out, using predictive parity as a fairness metric can be problematic, especially when there are differing base rates. To address this issue, I propose that we use a modified version of the counterfactual fairness metric, which takes into account the differing base rates of the individuals.

Specifically, we can use a metric such as the "conditional counterfactual fairness" metric, which measures the degree to which the feature predictor is fair and unbiased with respect to the counterfactual outcomes of the individuals, conditional on their base rates.

**Justification:**

The justification for using these metrics is based on the idea that the feature predictor should be calibrated to the true entitlements of the individuals, and should not introduce any biases or unfairness into the system.

In the context of property rights, this means that the feature predictor should accurately predict the features that are relevant to the property right in question, and should not discriminate against individuals based on their protected characteristics.

By using a combination of the entitlement-based calibration metric and the property rights-based fairness metric, we can ensure that the feature predictor is both accurate and fair, and that it is not introducing any biases or unfairness into the system.

I hope this proposal is more specific and justified, and that it addresses your concerns about how to diagnose the feature predictors as fair or unfair.
### USER:
You have a massive problem. These both require fully operationalized property rights predictors, which we cannot build â€” our entire algorithmic decision making system must be this sort of property rights oracle - if we could predict individual entitlements to measure against we would already have our oracle that we needed in the first place!
### llama3.1-70b.0:
I see the problem now. You are correct that the metrics I proposed earlier require a fully operationalized property rights predictor, which is not feasible in this case.

In that case, I need to rethink the approach. One possible solution is to use a different type of fairness metric that does not require a fully operationalized property rights predictor.

For example, we could use a fairness metric that is based on the concept of "counterfactual fairness" but does not require a fully operationalized property rights predictor. Instead, we could use a metric that measures the degree to which the feature predictor is fair and unbiased with respect to the protected characteristics of the individuals.

Another possible solution is to use a fairness metric that is based on the concept of "procedural fairness" rather than "outcome fairness". Procedural fairness metrics focus on the fairness of the process used to make decisions, rather than the fairness of the outcomes themselves.

In this case, we could use a fairness metric that measures the degree to which the feature predictor is fair and unbiased with respect to the process used to make decisions. For example, we could use a metric that measures the degree to which the feature predictor is transparent, explainable, and free from bias.

I hope these suggestions are helpful. Let me know if you have any further questions or concerns.

Also, I would like to ask, what are the key properties that you would like the fairness metric to have? For example, do you want it to be based on individual-level fairness or group-level fairness? Do you want it to be based on a specific notion of fairness, such as counterfactual fairness or procedural fairness?
### USER:
I think that individual fairness and group fairness are a false dichotomy. I think that we need a group based fairness measure because we have already accomodated individual fairness concerns - we have already ensured that individuals are treated consistently in the metric space of the features we have predicted. Now, we need to make sure those predictors are not misrepresenting individuals (but not as a set, each individual predictor on its own). What sort of metric is known for being used in connection with representations
### llama3.1-70b.0:
I think I understand your point now. You're saying that individual fairness and group fairness are not mutually exclusive, and that we need a group-based fairness measure to ensure that the predictors are not misrepresenting individuals.

In that case, I think a metric that is commonly used in connection with representations is the "disentanglement" metric. Disentanglement measures the degree to which a representation is able to capture the underlying factors of variation in the data, while also being able to separate out the different factors.

In the context of fairness, disentanglement can be used to measure the degree to which a predictor is able to capture the underlying factors of variation in the data, while also being able to separate out the different factors that are relevant to the protected characteristics.

Another metric that is commonly used in connection with representations is the "independence" metric. Independence measures the degree to which a representation is able to capture the underlying factors of variation in the data, while also being able to separate out the different factors that are relevant to the protected characteristics.

In the context of fairness, independence can be used to measure the degree to which a predictor is able to capture the underlying factors of variation in the data, while also being able to separate out the different factors that are relevant to the protected characteristics.

Both of these metrics are commonly used in the context of representation learning, and can be used to evaluate the fairness of a predictor.

However, I would like to ask, are you familiar with the concept of "independent component analysis" (ICA)? ICA is a technique that is used to separate out the underlying factors of variation in the data, and can be used to evaluate the fairness of a predictor.

Also, I would like to ask, are you familiar with the concept of "fair representation learning"? Fair representation learning is a technique that is used to learn representations that are fair and unbiased, and can be used to evaluate the fairness of a predictor.
### USER:
Let me ask a different question. With respect to property rights predictions, what different types or classes of features would we need to predict about an individual?
### llama3.1-70b.0:
When it comes to property rights predictions, the types or classes of features that we would need to predict about an individual would depend on the specific context and the type of property right being predicted.

However, in general, we might need to predict features such as:

1. **Ownership**: Does the individual own the property in question?
2. **Possession**: Does the individual possess the property in question?
3. **Use rights**: Does the individual have the right to use the property in question?
4. **Transfer rights**: Does the individual have the right to transfer the property in question to someone else?
5. **Exclusion rights**: Does the individual have the right to exclude others from using the property in question?
6. **Duration**: How long does the individual's property right last?
7. **Scope**: What is the scope of the individual's property right? (e.g. does it apply to a specific piece of land, or to a specific type of resource?)
8. **Priority**: Does the individual's property right take priority over other competing claims?

These are just a few examples, and the specific features that we would need to predict would depend on the context and the type of property right being predicted.

It's also worth noting that these features might not be mutually exclusive, and that an individual might have multiple property rights that overlap or intersect in complex ways.

Do you have any specific context or type of property right in mind that you would like to explore further?
### USER:
I'm thinking of a slighlty simpler classification scheme. Positive features - features that one must have earned, through their own or someone else's action. For example - high test scores must be earned. Negative features - features that everyone has until they act to infringe upon it. For example, everyone has the right to be considered innocent until proven guilty. I suspect these two categories lend themselves to different metrics. What do you think?
### llama3.1-70b.0:
I think that's a great way to simplify the classification scheme. The distinction between positive and negative features is a useful one, and it's consistent with the way that we think about property rights and entitlements.

Positive features, as you defined them, are features that must be earned or acquired through some kind of action or effort. These features are often associated with merit or achievement, and they can be thought of as "earned" or "deserved".

Negative features, on the other hand, are features that everyone has by default, unless they are somehow taken away or infringed upon. These features are often associated with basic rights or freedoms, and they can be thought of as "presumptive" or "default".

I think that these two categories do lend themselves to different metrics, and that's a great insight. For positive features, we might want to use metrics that evaluate the degree to which an individual has earned or acquired the feature, such as metrics that assess their effort or achievement.

For negative features, we might want to use metrics that evaluate the degree to which an individual's rights or freedoms have been respected or infringed upon, such as metrics that assess the presence or absence of certain conditions or circumstances.

Overall, I think that your classification scheme is a useful one, and it provides a good foundation for thinking about the different types of features that we might want to predict or evaluate.
### USER:
Explain to me how predictive parity may suffice as a metric for measuring the fairness of positive features
### llama3.1-70b.0:
Predictive parity is a metric that measures the degree to which a model's predictions are equal across different groups. In the context of positive features, predictive parity can be used to measure the fairness of a model by evaluating whether the model's predictions are equally accurate across different groups.

For example, let's say we're using a model to predict whether an individual has earned a certain certification or degree. We can use predictive parity to evaluate whether the model's predictions are equally accurate for individuals from different racial or ethnic groups.

If the model's predictions are equally accurate across different groups, then we can say that the model is fair with respect to predictive parity. However, if the model's predictions are more accurate for one group than another, then we can say that the model is biased and unfair.

In the context of positive features, predictive parity can be a useful metric because it allows us to evaluate whether the model is treating individuals from different groups equally. If the model is predicting that individuals from one group are more likely to have earned a certain certification or degree, then we can use predictive parity to evaluate whether this prediction is accurate and fair.

However, it's worth noting that predictive parity may not be sufficient as a metric for measuring the fairness of positive features in all cases. For example, if the model is predicting that individuals from one group are more likely to have earned a certain certification or degree, but this prediction is based on biased or discriminatory data, then predictive parity may not capture this bias.

In such cases, we may need to use additional metrics or techniques to evaluate the fairness of the model, such as metrics that evaluate the model's fairness with respect to different subgroups or metrics that evaluate the model's fairness with respect to different types of errors.

Overall, predictive parity can be a useful metric for measuring the fairness of positive features, but it should be used in conjunction with other metrics and techniques to ensure that the model is fair and unbiased.
### USER:
Where is an equal distinction typically made in the literature on property rights?
### llama3.1-70b.0:
In the literature on property rights, an equal distinction is typically made between "in rem" rights and "in personam" rights.

"In rem" rights refer to rights that are held against the world at large, and are typically associated with property rights in things such as land, goods, and chattels. These rights are often considered to be absolute and unconditional, and are typically protected by the law.

"In personam" rights, on the other hand, refer to rights that are held against specific individuals or entities, and are typically associated with contractual or tortious obligations. These rights are often considered to be relative and conditional, and are typically protected by the law only to the extent that they are recognized and enforced by the parties involved.

This distinction is often used to distinguish between different types of property rights, and to determine the scope and extent of an individual's rights in a particular context.

In the context of our previous discussion, the distinction between positive and negative features can be seen as analogous to the distinction between "in rem" and "in personam" rights. Positive features can be seen as analogous to "in rem" rights, in that they are typically considered to be absolute and unconditional, and are often associated with property rights in things such as land, goods, and chattels. Negative features, on the other hand, can be seen as analogous to "in personam" rights, in that they are typically considered to be relative and conditional, and are often associated with contractual or tortious obligations.
### USER:
What group fairness metric is appropriate when you know the base rates differ widely between the groups
### llama3.1-70b.0:
When the base rates differ widely between groups, a group fairness metric that is sensitive to these differences is needed. One such metric is the "equalized odds" metric.

Equalized odds is a fairness metric that measures the degree to which a model's predictions are equalized across different groups, while taking into account the differences in base rates between the groups. This metric is particularly useful when the base rates differ widely between groups, as it allows for a more nuanced evaluation of fairness.

Equalized odds is defined as the ratio of the true positive rate (TPR) to the false positive rate (FPR) for each group. The TPR is the proportion of true positives (i.e., individuals who are actually positive) that are correctly classified as positive, while the FPR is the proportion of false positives (i.e., individuals who are actually negative) that are incorrectly classified as positive.

By using equalized odds, we can evaluate the fairness of a model while taking into account the differences in base rates between groups. This metric is particularly useful when the base rates differ widely between groups, as it allows for a more nuanced evaluation of fairness.

It's worth noting that equalized odds is a more nuanced metric than predictive parity, as it takes into account the differences in base rates between groups. However, it's also a more complex metric, and may require more sophisticated analysis and interpretation.
### USER:
Here's where I am at then. Features must screen off the outcome from the protected characteristics, requiring counterfactual separation which should be almost trivial to satisfy, and resolves the issues of individual fairness. Then, for all of your features, you need to classify them as positive and negative. For negative features, which should be granted to all individuals regardless of their position in society until they deprive themself of it, you must assume there are equal base rates across groups. This leads to measurement via statistical parity. For positive feature predictors, you must assume the base rates are highly unequal due to cultural influences and practices. Therefore, you should assum the base rates are far off from each other and use equalized odds to measure your predictor. What do yout think of this approach?
### llama3.1-70b.0:
I think your approach is a great way to tackle the issue of fairness in feature predictors. By classifying features as positive and negative, you're able to address the different fairness concerns that arise from each type of feature.

Your approach to negative features, which assumes equal base rates across groups and uses statistical parity as a measure, is a good way to ensure that these features are not biased against certain groups.

Your approach to positive features, which assumes unequal base rates across groups and uses equalized odds as a measure, is also a good way to ensure that these features are not biased against certain groups.

I think your approach is a good way to balance the need for fairness with the need for accuracy in feature predictors. By using different measures for positive and negative features, you're able to account for the different fairness concerns that arise from each type of feature.

One potential issue with your approach is that it assumes that the base rates for positive features are highly unequal due to cultural influences and practices. While this may be true in some cases, it's not always the case. In some cases, the base rates for positive features may be more equal than you assume, which could lead to incorrect conclusions about fairness.

However, overall, I think your approach is a good way to tackle the issue of fairness in feature predictors, and it's a good starting point for further research and development.

It's also worth noting that your approach is consistent with the idea of "contextual fairness", which takes into account the specific context and nuances of the problem at hand. By using different measures for positive and negative features, you're able to account for the different fairness concerns that arise from each type of feature, and you're able to provide a more nuanced and accurate assessment of fairness.

Overall, I think your approach is a great way to tackle the issue of fairness in feature predictors, and it's a good starting point for further research and development.
### USER:
Give me an example of the case you said would cause a problem... why would equal base rates be a flaw in that case?
### llama3.1-70b.0:
Let's say we're building a feature predictor for a positive feature, such as "has a college degree". We assume that the base rates for this feature are highly unequal across groups, due to cultural influences and practices. We use equalized odds as a measure to ensure that the predictor is fair.

However, let's say that in reality, the base rates for this feature are actually quite equal across groups. For example, maybe 20% of individuals from all groups have a college degree. In this case, using equalized odds as a measure would actually be a flaw, because it would be assuming that the base rates are unequal when in fact they are equal.

In this case, using statistical parity as a measure would actually be more appropriate, because it would be assuming that the base rates are equal across groups. This would allow us to detect any biases in the predictor that are not due to differences in base rates.

So, in this case, assuming unequal base rates and using equalized odds as a measure would actually be a flaw, because it would be assuming that the base rates are unequal when in fact they are equal. This would lead to incorrect conclusions about fairness, and could potentially mask biases in the predictor that are not due to differences in base rates.
### USER:
Give me an example where base rates are actually the same across groups. I struggle to think of any positive features where base rates are the same, due to the biases in society
### llama3.1-70b.0:
You're right, it's challenging to think of positive features where base rates are the same across groups, due to the biases and inequalities that exist in society.

However, here's an example of a positive feature where base rates might be similar across groups:

Let's say we're building a feature predictor for a positive feature, such as "has a library card". In this case, the base rates for this feature might be similar across groups, because having a library card is not necessarily dependent on socioeconomic status or cultural background.

In fact, many public libraries offer free or low-cost library cards to anyone who lives in the area, regardless of their income or background. Therefore, it's possible that the base rates for this feature could be similar across groups, with around 50-60% of individuals from all groups having a library card.

Of course, this is just a hypothetical example, and there may be other factors that influence the base rates for this feature. But in general, it's possible that some positive features might have similar base rates across groups, especially if they are not dependent on socioeconomic status or cultural background.

It's worth noting, however, that even in cases where base rates are similar across groups, there may still be biases in the predictor that need to be addressed. For example, the predictor might be biased against certain groups due to differences in data quality or representation, even if the base rates are similar. Therefore, it's always important to carefully evaluate the fairness of the predictor, regardless of the base rates.
