In the previous sections, we have shown the difficulty of connecting the
philosophy of distributive justice to the practice of algorithmic fairness. 
Despite assertions in the literature that specific fairness measures relate to
types of egalitarianism, we have shown that connections don't hold up under
scrutiny. This difficulty warrants a reevaluation of the philosophical
foundations of algorithmic fairness, and we propose that entitlement justice is
a more apt framework for understanding the goals of fairness in algorithmic
decision-making systems.

On an entitlement fairness account, an algorithmic decision-maker becomes a
property rights oracle. The system at large is responsible for determining which
individuals are entitled to a particular property. This requires two steps:
first, we must know all of the factors which are morally relevant to property
rights in the domain in question and be able to assign values to those factors
for each individual in a population. Some of these factors we may be able to 
simply observe or measure directly, while many of these factors will have to be
predicted algorithmically. For example, in the case of criminal parole,
likelihood of recidivism is clearly relevant to one's entitlement to parole, but
is something which must be predicted or learned from data. Second, we must
implement an entitlement rule which determines whether or not an individual is
entitled to a property based on the values of the morally relevant factors that
we've predicted. Note that our decision-maker has now been split into two
explicit components with very specific purposes. Following reasoning presented
in~\cite{Kuppler_2021}, refer to these steps as the prediction step and the
decision step, respectively. We now have a pipeline which appears as follows:

\begin{center}
    \includegraphics[scale=0.5]{figs/fig2.png}\\
    \textbf{Fig. 2: Algorithmic Decision-Making Pipeline}
\end{center}

In order to implement this pipeline, one must have a clear understanding of the
property right in question, and the morally relevant factors which determine
entitlement to that property. Note that these factors may be related to
sensitive social categories. For example, if I am determining property rights to
land, ancestral heritage may be a morally relevant factor. Then we know that
protected attributes are allowed to play a role in the prediction step, so long
as they are morally relevant to the property right in question and the moral
reasoning behind their inclusion is made explicit. In the decision step, however,
these attributes must be excluded, and the decision must be made based only on
the predicted morally relevant factors, since only these are the features which
have been shown to be relevant to the property right in question.

Therefore, measuring the fairness of an algorithmic decision-making system under
the entitlement justice framework means that we need to require that the
protected characteristics of an individual act on the decision \textit{only}
through those features which are morally relevant to the property right in
question. If we can ensure this, then we have a system in which sensitive
characteristics of an individual are used to assess their entitlement to a
particular property in only ways which are explicitly morally justified, and 
otherwise do not play a role in the decision-making process. This notion is
precisely formulated as the following specific form of counterfactual fairness:

\begin{definition}
    Given a set of covariates $X$, a set of protected attributes $A$, a set of
    morally justified derived features $D$, and a classification function $f$,
    a decision-making system satisfies \textbf{entitlement fairness} iff 
    \[P[f(X) = 1 | D=d, do(A = a)] = P[f(x) = 1 | D=d, do(A=b)]\;\forall a, b \in A\]
\end{definition}

In other words, the morally justified feature set $D$ acts as a mediator between
the protected attributes $A$ and the decision $f(X)$, and no further influence
of $A$ on $f(x)$ is allowed. In the following discussion, we will show the
advantages of adopting this perspective on algorithmic fairness.

\subsection{End-state vs. Historical Fairness}

Consider Nozick's distinction between end-state and historical theories of
justice. In an end-state theory, to know if any allocation of one good to a
person is just, we must know the broader distribution of all similar goods
across society as a whole. This poses a major challenge to algorithmic fairness
because it requires the decision-maker to have evolving data about individuals'
stocks across society. This type of dataset is impossible to maintain and
provide to the decision maker in practice. In contrast, historical theories of
justice need only focus on the single particular good which is subject to a
decision or allocation. While it could still be difficult to determine the full
historical context of a good, it is at least a goal which is much more in line
with the capabilities of an algorithmic system as we will show.

In the entitlement fairness framework, the decision-maker is a property rights
oracle. The decision-maker is responsible for determining whether or not an
individual is entitled to a particular property. This is a historical theory of
justice because one's entitlement to a property is determined by some
transactional history of the property. In the case of physical goods, this sort
of structure is obvious â€” a good was acquired and then passed along through
transfers of ownership into the hands of the current owner. Algorithmic decision
makers seldom deal with physical goods, however. Instead, they tend to deal with
opportunities. For example, college decisions allocate the opportunity to attend
a particular university. Loan decisions allocate the opportunity purchase a
house, start a business, or undertake other actions which require capital on
credit. What sort of transactional history is there for these opportunities? And
how does it impact one's entitlement to them?

In each of these cases, the transactional history is the history of opportunity
given to the individual in question by society throughout their life. Consider
some example cases:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{College Admissions} (Access to education): Equality of
          opportunity in education is an entitlement justly acquired by each
          individual at birth. Since each individual is entitled to equal
          opportunity, there are no meaningful transfers of this opportunity
          between individuals. Therefore, the relevant history is only the
          acquisition combined with any infringements on the equality of
          opportunity. Under an entitlement framework, an individual who has
          been deprived of equal opportunity is entitled to rectification. Now
          note that we are able to predict based on, say, zip code and race,
          the extent to which an individual has been systemically deprived of
          equal opportunity. This means that we can predict the relevant history
          in the prediction step, and then use that information in our
          entitlement rule, successfully implementing a historical theory of
          justice.
    \item \textbf{Loan Decisions} (Access to capital): Unlike education, access
          to capital is not an automatic entitlement granted to individuals
          equally at birth. Instead, access to capital is based on merit.
          However, we will still employ a similar structure. An individual
          reaches a particular level of merit, acquiring the right to access
          capital. This merit is acquired through a history of work, education,
          and other actions and features relevant to the domain. However, past
          decisions about one's access to capital are certainly influenced by
          social categories and other factors which are not relevant to merit.
          Via some combination of income, race, and other factors, we can
          certainly predict whether one is more likely to have been unjustly
          deprived of access to capital, or unjustly rewarded with undeserved
          access to capital. This means that we can predict the relevant history
          in the prediction step, and then use that information in our
          entitlement rule to implement a historical theory of justice.
\end{itemize}

In each of these cases, it is not trivial to implement the relevant history, and
requires extensive moral reasoning and domain-specific knowledge. However, the
upshot is that using the entitlement fairness framework, we are able to implement
a historical theory of justice in algorithmic decision-making systems, while 
implementing a truly end-state theory of justice would be impossible due to the
required knowledge of the full distribution of goods across individuals in society.

\subsection{Domain Specificity}

In addition to the distinction between end-state and historical theories of
justice, we also gain a new perspective on dmain specificity of fairness. In
the algorithmic fairness literature, there are often broad attempts to reduce a
multitude of fairness concerns to a single mathematical measure. However, this
approach can reduce the visibility of the specific justice concerns of a
particular domain, and possibly obscure the goals of fairness in that domain.
For example, consider the COMPAS algorithm for assigning risk scores to 
individuals in the criminal justice system. The risk scores output by COMPAS 
are meant to represent likelihood of recidivism to inform decisions about
bail, sentencing, and parole. A now infamous ProPublica
article~\cite{Angwin_2016} showed that the COMPAS algorithm was biased against
African Americans by measuring the false positive rate of the algorithm across
racial groups. The false positive rate is clearly relevant to justice in this 
context, given that a false positive can lead to more frequent and longer 
incarcertations. However, Northepoint (the company which produces COMPAS)
argued that their algorithm was fair because it had equal predictive accuracy
across racial groups~\cite{Flores_2016}. Notice that on the entitlement fairness
account, we would have detected the issues here â€” evaluation of the recidivism
risk predictor would have revealed that it was not fair under equalized odds,
meaning a different predictor would have been required to implement the decision
rule. (Note that it is also highly unlikely that distributing sentences
according to recidivism risk alone would qualify as a just rule of entitlement
as well.)

Domain specificity is also critical to the selection of $A$, the set of 
protected attributes which should be considered in a fairness measure. In the
algorithmic fairness literature, there is often a focus on selecting $A$ to
represent social categories, however there may be times when a social category
is morally relevant to a particular decision. In the case of land ownership, for
example, the ancestral heritage of an individual may be morally relevant to 
decisions about land allocation. In this case, it would be inappropriate to
remove the attribute of ancestral heritage from the decision-making process.
This effect is captured by the entitlement fairness framework. In deriving the
set of features which must be predicted to implement the entitlement rule, we
are forced to consider the domain-specific moral reasoning which is relevant to
the property right in question. We then require that \emph{only} those features
not included in this set are excluded from the decision-making process. So for
the case of land ownership, we may include a predictor of ancestal heritage in 
the prediction step, while still excluding race from the decision step â€” i.e,
the only impact of race on the decision is through its impact on ancestral
heritage.

Entitlement justice provides a framework for understanding the domain-specific
considerations of fairness â€” as we discussed above, property rights are specific
to the type of holding in question. Designing and building a system which
respects property rights requires a deep understanding of the domain in which
the system will be used. Understanding the fairness of a system in terms of 
entitlement justice therefore bakes in the domain-specific considerations of
fairness into the design of the system.

\subsection{A Framework for Entitlement Fairness}

The presentation of entitlement fairness above is a high level description of
how a system may achieve fairness. In this section, we present a framework for
implementing entitlement fairness in algorithmic decision-making systems, so 
that the goals of fairness can be achieved in practice.
\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Define the property being allocated by the decision-making
    system}. This may be a physical good, an opportunity, a right, or some other
    type of property. There may be multiple framings of property when studying a
    particular problem domain. For example, in the home loan case, you may think
    that the property being allocated is access to capital, or you may think
    that the property being allocated is the opportunity to purchase a home.
    Both options will carry with them different moral reasoning processes, and
    it is important to consider one's options carefully to select the property
    with the most significant moral concerns.
    \item \textbf{Define the set of attributes which are morally relevant to the
    entitlement to the property}. The implementor of the decision-making system
    must identify and \emph{morally justify} the features of an individual which
    are relevant to their entitlement to the property in question. This set of
    attributes will vary widely depending on the property right in question.
    \item \textbf{Implement predictors for the morally relevant features}.
    For each of the morally relevant features identified in the previous step,
    implement a predictor which predicts the value of that feature for each
    individual in the population. These predictors may be simple or complex,
    depending on the nature of the feature and the data available. The important
    thing is that the predictors must be able to predict the morally relevant
    features with some degree of accuracy.
    \item \textbf{Implement a fair entitlement rule}. Use the features predicted
    in step 3 to implement an entitlement rule which determines whether or not
    an individual is entitled to the property in question. There are many
    options for implementing an entitlement rule. One may implement something as
    straightforward as a decision tree or linear model based on the predicted
    features, or one may implement a less transparent model such as a neural
    network which learns the entitlement rule from some data.
    \item \textbf{Verify the fairness of the system}. Once the system has been
    implemented, it is important to verify that the system is fair. This may
    involve testing the system on a holdout dataset, or using a fairness measure
    to verify that the system is fair. The fairness measure should be based on
    the definition of entitlement fairness given above.
    \item \textbf{Publish moral reasoning and aknowledge limitations}. The
    final step in the framework is to publish the moral reasoning behind the
    morally relevant features and the entitlement rule. This will allow for
    public scrutiny of the rule and the identification of any limitations in the
    system.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Instrumental Algorithmic Decisions}

Recall that under the entitlement fairness framework, the decision-maker is a
property rights oracle. This means that regardless of the implementation or the
problem domain, the outcome of the system describes whether or not an individual
is entitled to a particular property under a system of entitlement. Returning to
our discussion of instrumental property rights from section 3, we now observe 
a natural limitation of algorithmic decision-makers under the entitlement
justice framework. Since, as Sen identified, property rights must be
instrumental, so too must the output of the decision-maker be instrumental. This
means that the decision of algorithmic decision-makers must not be absolute.
There must be some flexibility in the decision-making process to allow for
the intervention on decisions based on higher priority issues in the broader
sociotechnical system in which the decision-maker is embedded. 

As an example, imagine that an algorithmic decision-maker is used to allocate
college admissions decisions to students. The decision-maker determines that a
particular student is entitled to admissions based on their academic merit in
combination with, say, excellent essays and recommendations. The student has 
gained a property right to admission. However, say the university becomes aware
of a higher priority issue â€” the student in question has serious disciplinary
issues that they feel would place other students at their university in danger.
The other students' rights to safety are more important than the student's
property right, and therefore the university must be able to intervene and deny
the student admission.

This type of intervention on the outputs of algorithmic decision-makers is often
advocated for in the literature on socio-technical systems, and is considered to
be a common sense measure, but critically, by considering the entitlement
approach to algorithmic fairness, we see that this intervention emerges as a
moral imperative, not just a pragmatic one. This is a significant benefit of
the entitlement justice interpretation of algorithmic fairness.
